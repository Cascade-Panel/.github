# Cascade Organization

Welcome to the **Cascade Organization**! We are dedicated to creating and maintaining powerful tools for managing and orchestrating containerized and virtualized environments. Our flagship projects include the Cascade Panel and Cascade CLI, designed to provide users with comprehensive solutions for managing their infrastructure.

## Projects

### Cascade Panel

**Cascade Panel** is an advanced web-based platform for managing Incus instances. It offers a unified dashboard for handling application containers, system containers, and virtual machines (VMs). Key features include:

- **Unified Dashboard**: Manage all your containers and VMs from a single interface.
- **Configurable API**: Run and manage multiple API versions concurrently.
- **Plan Management**: Purchase and manage access to various features and instances.
- **JWT Cookie-Based API**: Secure communication between the backend and the web UI.
- **Flexible Database Options**: Supports any database compatible with SQLAlchemy.
- **Customizable Caching Storage**: Options include memcached, Redis, SQLite3, or a custom system.

### Cascade CLI

**Cascade CLI** is a command-line interface tool designed to complement the Cascade Panel. It allows users to interact with Cascade services directly from the terminal, providing automation and scripting capabilities for managing their infrastructure. Key features include:

- **Command-Line Management**: Access and control your Cascade services from the terminal.
- **Automation**: Integrate with scripts and automation tools for seamless operations.
- **Comprehensive CLI Options**: Manage instances, containers, and other features directly from the command line.
